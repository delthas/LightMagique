# LightMagique

**A small 3D real-time multiplayer videogame written in Java.**

The graphics are done from scratch with OpenGL (actually the LWJGL3 wrapper). The networking part uses a [small network UDP library](https://github.com/delthas/network) I have created based on Glenn Fidler networking articles.

I originally developed this game in only an afternoon (because I had created quite a lot of training projects like this before) but I have added new features over time after some playtests with friends.
